\title{Plot method for the chemmodlab class.}
\usage{
\method{plot}{chemmodlab}(x, max.select = NA, splits = 1:x$nsplits,
  meths = x$models, series = "both", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an object of class \code{\link{chemmodlab}}.}

\item{max.select}{the maximum number of tests to plot for the
accumulation curve. If \code{max.select} is not specified, 
use \code{floor(min(300,n/4))},
where \code{n} is the number of compounds.}

\item{splits}{a numeric vector containing the indices of the splits to use to construct
accumulation curves.  Default is to use all splits. \code{NA} means the first series
of plots are not generated. See \code{Details}.}

\item{meths}{a character vector with statistical methods implemented in
\code{chemmodlab}.  The 
statistical methods to use for the second series of plots.  
This argument can take the same values
as argument \code{models} in function \code{\link{ModelTrain}}. See \code{Details}.}

\item{series}{a character vector.  Which series of plots to construct. Can be one of
\code{"descriptors"}, \code{"methods"}, \code{"both"}.}

\item{...}{other parameters to be passed through to plotting functions.}
}
\description{
\code{plot.chemmodlab} takes a \code{\link{chemmodlab}} object output by the
\code{\link{ModelTrain}} function and creates a series of accumulation curve
plots for assesing model and descriptor set performance.
}
\details{
For a binary response, the accumulation curve plots the number of assay hits
identified as a function of the number of tests conducted, where testing
order is determined by the predicted probability of a response being positive
obtained from k-fold cross
validation. Given a particular compound collection, larger accumulations are
preferable.

The accumulation curve has also been extended to continuous responses.
Assuming large positive values of a continuous response y are preferable,
\code{chemmodlab}
accumulates \code{y} so that \eqn{\sum y_i} is the sum of the \code{y}
over the first \code{n} tests. This extension includes the binary-response
accumulation curve as a special case.

By default, we display accumulation curves up to 300 tests, not for the
entire collection, to focus on the goal of finding actives as early as
possible.

There are two main series of plots generated:
}
\section{Methods plot series}{

 There is one plot per CV split and descriptor set
 combination. The accumulation curves for each modeling
  method is compared.
}

\section{Descriptors plot series}{

 There is one plot per CV split and model fit. The
 accumulation curves for each descriptor set is
 compared.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# A data set with  binary response and multiple descriptor sets
data(aid364)

cml <- ModelTrain(aid364, ids = TRUE, xcol.lengths = c(24, 147), 
                  des.names = c("BurdenNumbers", "Pharmacophores"))
plot(cml)
}

# A continuous response
cml <- ModelTrain(USArrests, nsplits = 2, nfolds = 2,
                  models = c("KNN", "Lasso", "Tree"))
plot(cml)
